HELLO ! 

My name is John, I love to code !

I mostly do Javascript and Node for backend, but I like using the new hip cool tools too like React and Tailwind. I've done a little EJS (To be honest not a huge fan, but it's alright) and some C# mostly for fun. Looking to get hired in the Vancouver B.C. area but I'd be willing to work remote or even relocate for the right position. 

Hit me up on twitter if you like, https://twitter.com/PocoJohnStewart

I like MTG and Dominions 5. 

 I was going to host a few small Unity projects on here, but they do thier own version control system so I don't know if I'll get around to it.
